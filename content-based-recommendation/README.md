# Content-Based Movie Recommendation System

## Dataset
MovieLens 25M Dataset  
Source: Kaggle  
File Used: movies.csv

## Problem Statement
Build a content-based recommendation system that suggests similar movies based on genre metadata.

## Approach
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature extraction from genres
- Vectorization using TF-IDF
- Cosine similarity computation
- Generate top-N similar movie recommendations

## Techniques Used
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Cosine Similarity

## Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n²) similarity computation  
Space Complexity: Depends on vectorized feature matrix

## Future Improvements
- Add ratings-based filtering
- Hybrid recommendation system
- Deploy using Streamlit / Flask
